Introduction

In today's competitive job market, both job seekers and recruiters face numerous challenges in navigating the hiring process efficiently. To address these challenges, this project presents a job portal system built using the MERN (Mongo DB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack, designed to streamline the recruitment process for both job seekers and companies. The platform incorporates three key modules: Admin, Jobseeker/Student, and Recruiter/Company, each tailored to meet the specific needs of the respective users.The Admin module allows for the effective management of the system, including oversight of user registrations, job postings, and recruiter activities. Job seekers, using the User module, can create profiles, search for jobs based on their skills, apply for positions, and track the status of their applications. Additionally, the platform offers job recommendations and supports live and virtual exams, enabling candidates to showcase their abilities through structured assessments.

Implementation Details
Modules:

Admin Module: 

The Admin module provides the administrator with a centralized interface to manage the job portal effectively. Admins can view the number of registered users, companies, and active job postings. They also have the authority to monitor and maintain data integrity across the system, ensuring smooth and efficient operations.

User Module (Jobseeker/Student):

The User module enables job seekers and students to register on the platform, create profiles, and log in to search for jobs that match their skills. The system provides skill-based job recommendations to enhance job search efficiency. Users can also apply for jobs, participate in virtual exams, view the status of their applications, and track their progress in real time

Recruiter Module (Company): 

The Recruiter module allows companies to register and log in to the portal. Recruiters can add job requirements, post new job openings, and create online assessments (MCQs) for applicants. They can also view candidate profiles, evaluate exam results, and make informed hiring decisions by selecting or rejecting applicants based on their performance and qualifications
